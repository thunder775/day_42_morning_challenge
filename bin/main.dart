// Write a function that takes an array of unordered integers and logs percentile
// values at 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 99% and 100%

// For example, given the list [8, 6, 6, 20, 9, 1, 12, 16, 3, 16, 22, 2] it should log the following:
//  25% of the numbers are less than or equal to 3
//  50% of the numbers are less than or equal to 8
//  75% of the numbers are less than or equal to 16
//  90% of the numbers are less than or equal to 20
//  95% of the numbers are less than or equal to 22
//  99% of the numbers are less than or equal to 22
//  100% of the numbers are less than or equal to 22
